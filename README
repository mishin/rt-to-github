This was a script to migrate RT tickets to GH issues. Dave Golden has a new
and improved version, which i would recommend over my implementation so have
git rm'd my script[1]. For Dave Golden's script see:

 * https://github.com/dagolden/zzz-rt-to-github
 * http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/2397/moving-cpan-rt-tickets-to-github-now-improved/

[1] You can still get to the script in this repo by git cloning and then a
git checkout fa311bce986eeef2c844659ee9d36e50364e361c
