DESCRIPTION
    This script will allow you to mass copy rt.cpan.org issues to issues in
    a github repo. It was used to successfully copy 89 of issues from two
    different RT distributions for the CGI.pm perl module to github, so it
    should work for you.

    The script does its best to copy all content from tickets, but there are
    some caveats:

        - No attachements will be copied
        - Original author data and timestamps will not be reflected in the new
          issue
        - That is to say, they will be included as part of the comments on the
          issue
          but the issue author/timestamp will be your github user details and
          the time this script copied the issue

    You can run the script with --dry-run as a first sanity check. If no
    information is supplied on the command line you will be prompted for it.
    You will need to add the following to the .git/config file in the
    git[hub] repo you are copying tickets to:

        [github]
            user = <your github user name>
            token = <your github API token>

    You can create a ~/.pause file to get the PAUSE login details, it should
    look like:

        user <your PAUSE user name>
        password <your PAUSE password>

    You will still be prompted for the information on the command line, so
    to make the script use the values defined in the above files supply
    --no-prompt

    To add a comment to the existing RT ticket(s) supply the --comment
    options - this will add a comment explaining that the ticket has been
    copied to github, with the url, and asking to send future correspondence
    there. The existing ticket will not be closed, but the comment will
    state that the RT ticket will be closed when the github issue is.
